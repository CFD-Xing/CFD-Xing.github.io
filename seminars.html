        <h2>CCSE Seminar: Multiscale and Multiphysics Modelling (Nov 1, 2017)</h2> 
		<h3>Title: Role of Multi-Scale Physics Modelling in LES of Turbulent Premixed Combustion</h3>
		<p>Prof. Clinton Groth, University of Toronto - Institute for Aerospace Studies</p>
		<h3>Abstract: </h3>
		<p>The importance and role of multi-scale physics modelling in the large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent premixed 
		flames will be discussed and a number of recently proposed subfilter-scale (SFS) combustion models for their prediction 
		will be described.  LES results for several premixed flames associated with the UTIAS Bunsen-type burner will also be 
		considered in order to illustrate current capabilities and limitations of the models and indicate the directions for 
		future study.</p>

		<h3>Title: Multiscale and multiphysics computational electromagnetics: retrospective, present, outlook</h3>
		<p>Prof. Costas Sarris, University of Toronto - Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</p>
		<h3>Abstract: </h3>
		<p>An overview of our research on multiscale problems in electromagnetics will be given, starting from wavelet-based 
		methods for nonlinear optics, an adaptive mesh refinement technique (AMR-FDTD) and more recently developed sub-gridding 
		techniques coupled with leap-from time stepping beyond the CFL limit, enabled by spatial filtering of fields. Moreover, 
		vector parabolic equation methods for large scale wave propagation problems, arising in wireless communication scenarios, 
		will be discussed, along with related uncertainty quantification studies. Finally, some multiphysics applications of 
		electromagnetic fields, motivating further research on both modeling and optimization techniques, will be discussed.</p>

		<h3>Title: Anisotropic Adaptive Mesh Refinement for Ideal Magnethohydrodynamics</h3>
		<p>Dr. Lucie Freret, University of Toronto - Institute for Aerospace Studies</p>
		<h3>Abstract: </h3>
		<p>A high-order central essentially non-oscillatory (CENO) finite-volume scheme combined with a block-based anisotropic 
		adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) algorithm is proposed for the solution of the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. 
		A generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM) divergence correction technique is applied to achieve numerically-divergent free 
		magnetic fields while preserving high-order accuracy. The cell-centered CENO method uses a hybrid reconstruction approach 
		based on a fixed central stencil. Smooth and fully resolved solution data is interpolated using an unlimited high-order 
		k-exact reconstruction. In cells deemed to have under-resolved/discontinuous solution content based on a smoothness indicator, 
		the high-order reconstruction reverts to a lower-order limited linear approach. The high-order CENO finite-volume scheme is 
		implemented with fourth-order spatial accuracy within a flexible multi-block hexahedral grid framework. Parallel 
		implementation and local anisotropic grid adaptivity are achieved by using a hierarchical block-based domain decomposition 
		strategy in which the connectivity and refinement history of grid blocks are tracked using a binary tree data structure. 
		Numerical results, including solution-driven anisotropic refinement of cubed-sphere grids are presented to demonstrate the 
		accuracy and efficiency of the proposed high-order solution method.</p>

        <h2>CCSE Seminar: Reduced-Order Modelling (Feb 2, 2018)</h2>
	    <h3>Title: Pore network modeling for investigating multiphase flows in fuel cells and electrolyzers</h3>
		<p>Prof. Aimy Bazylak, University of Toronto - Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</p>
		<h3>Abstract: </h3>
		<p>The hydrogen polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell provides enormous potential for a future with clean energy. However, 
		PEM fuel cells have not yet reached widespread commercial adoption, and key barriers are related to inefficient mass transport in 
		microscale porous materials. Mass transport limitations arising from liquid water flooding in low temperature PEM fuel cells and 
		acid leaching in high temperature PEM fuel cells leads to significant inefficiencies. If these issues become resolved, smaller and 
		more reliable devices could be produced at a lower cost. Mass transport limitations can be minimized through the development of 
		optimized materials, which have tailored pore structures, connectivities, conductivities, and surface wettabilities. The porous 
		materials in PEM fuel cells could be customized for mass transport with detailed information about their structure and the dominating 
		mass transport mechanisms that result from these structures. In this talk, I will discuss pore network modelling as a highly 
		computationally efficient means of investigating multiphase transport in PEM fuel cells and electrolyzers.</p>

		<h3>Title: A Dissipation Theory for FDTD With Application to the Stable Model Order Reduction of FDTD Equations</h3>
		<p>Prof. Piero Triverio, University of Toronto - Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</p>
        <h3>Abstract: </h3>
        <p>The Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is a very popular explicit scheme to solve Maxwell's equations. Model order 
		reduction has been proposed to accelerate FDTD in multiscale scenarios. However, proving the stability of an FDTD scheme with 
		embedded reduced models is a formidable task. In this talk, we first establish a connection between the FDTD method and the theory 
		of dissipative systems. We show that the FDTD equations for a given region can be seen as a dynamical system which is dissipative 
		under a generalized Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. Based on the concept of dissipation, we present a powerful theoretical 
		framework to create advanced FDTD-like schemes with guaranteed stability, where stability conditions can be given for the individual 
		components (e.g. boundary conditions, meshes, embedded reduced models) rather than for the whole coupled scheme. Using the proposed 
		theory, we show how reduced models can be systematically generated and embedded into a main FDTD mesh with a rigorous guarantee of 
		stability.</p>

		<h3>Title: Model reduction for parametrized partial differential equations</h3>
		<p>Prof. Masayuki Yano, University of Toronto - Institute for Aerospace Studies</p>
		<h3>Abstract: </h3>
		<p>We discuss a model reduction method that enables rapid and reliable solution of parametrized partial differential equations 
		(PDEs) in continuum mechanics. Our interest is in many-query scenarios, which require solution evaluation for a large number 
		different parameter values, each of which often in real time. The model reduction approach comprises three key ingredients: 
		reduced basis spaces that provide rapidly convergent approximations to the parametric manifold; a posteriori error estimates 
		which quantify the error in the solutions; offline-online computational decomposition which allows us to construct, once, a 
		reduced model in the offline stage and invoke, many times, the reduced model in the online stage.</p>

	    <h3>Title: Improving Robustness of CFD Applications through Output-Based Adaptive Methods</h3>
		<p>Prof. Krzysztof Fidkowski, University of Michigan - Department of Aerospace Engineering</p>
		<h3>Abstract: </h3>
		<p>Aerodynamic analysis and design applications are increasingly relying on high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations, 
		which are becoming more complex as a result of advances in both hardware and algorithms. However, as simulations become more complex, 
		so does the task of ensuring accuracy of the results, which have a direct impact on the application of interest. For large, 
		multidisciplinary problems, expert practitioners cannot reliably assess accuracy of a simulation through visual inspection alone, and 
		best-practice meshing and verification guidelines may not apply to the analysis of novel configurations. This presentation introduces 
		output-based methods for addressing this situation by automating the process of estimating errors and improving fidelity, so that 
		robustness of the solution process can be vastly improved. Output-based methods rely on the solution of an auxiliary adjoint problem, 
		which has already seen application to shape optimization and data assimilation. We explore many uses of the adjoint solution for optimizing 
		computations relevant to aerospace engineering, including steady-state mesh refinement, unstructured mesh optimization, adapting in space 
		and time for unsteady simulations, and adapting both the mesh and approximation order in high-order methods. We also present new results 
		from ongoing projects in improving efficiency of the calculation of the error estimates, and in combining mesh optimization with shape 
		optimization.</p>

        <h2>CCSE Seminar: Invited talk (June 15, 2018)</h2>
	    <h3> Title: A numerical method for modeling interfacial flows with variable surface tension</h3>
		<p>Prof. Shahriar Afkhami, New Jersey Institute of Technology - Department of Mathematical Sciences</p>
		<h3>Abstract: </h3>
        <p>Accurate modeling of surface tension effects has been a focus of research in the past twenty years, due to its importance in understanding and 
		predicting a variety of two-phase flow problems. Amongst all the Eulerian representations of the surface tension, the Volume-of-Fluid method has 
		enjoyed major progress recently. Here I discuss some of advances we have made in the case of variable surface tension, where "localized" tangential 
		(Marangoni) stresses are included in the Volume-of-Fluid formulation. The implementation is general, i.e. it applies to both temperature and concentration 
		dependent surface tension coefficient, along with the setups involving a large jump in the temperature between the fluid and its surrounding, as well as 
		the situations where the concentration should be strictly confined to the fluid domain, such as the mixing of fluids with different surface tension 
		coefficients. The applicability of our method is demonstrated via examples of thermocapillary migration of bubbles, and spreading and mixing of drops 
		on a miscible liquid of different surface tension. I will also discuss future directions to model surfactants.</p>

        <h2>CCSE Seminar: Invited talk (Nov. 30, 2018)</h2>
	    <h3>Title: Spline collocation methods for a PDE with discontinuous diffusion coefficient</h3>
		<p>Prof. Christina Christara, University of Toronto - Department of Computer Science</p>
		<h3>Abstract: </h3>
		<p>We consider spline collocation PDE discretization methods and their application to discontinuous diffusion parabolic PDEs. Spline collocation methods 
		have been shown to be competitive PDE discretization techniques for BVPs and IVPs, under the assumption, among other, that the coefficients of the PDE are 
		continuous functions. However, as with any PDE discretization method, when the method is applied to problems with discontinuous coefficients, convergence 
		and/or the regular order of convergence exhibited on continuous problems are not necessarily obtained and special attention is required. We study spline 
		collocation methods for solving a one-dimensional discontinuous diffusion parabolic PDE, where the discontinuity of the diffusion results in a particular 
		form of discontinuity for the solution derivative. We formulate methods that handle the discontinuity, either by applying the discontinuity condition 
		directly, or by modifying the spline basis functions appropriately, or by employing adaptive grids. We discuss the properties of the methods and present 
		numerical results on various problems, including a parabolic PDE problem modelling brain cancer growth.</p>

	    <h3>Title: Multi-scale modeling of polydisperse multiphase flows using quadrature-based moment method</h3>
		<p>Prof. Rodney O. Fox, Iowa State University - Department of Chemical Engineering</p>
        <h3>Abstract: </h3>
		<p>Quadrature-based moment methods (QBMM) are employed to solve kinetic and population balance equations and are especially useful for systems far from 
		equilibrium. Examples include highly compressible and disperse multiphase flows. Starting from the closed mesoscale model, the unclosed moment equations are 
		formulated and closed using QBMM. The order of the closure is controlled by the order of the moments used in QBMM. For example, dilute particle laden flows 
		can be described by a kinetic equation for the particle-phase velocity distribution function (VDF), and successfully closed with velocity moments up to 
		fourth order. The numerical algorithms used to solve moment equations must be consistent with the mesoscale model. For example, the numerical methods 
		employed to solve the spatial advection terms and the source terms must guarantee that the moments remain realizable (i.e., they must correspond to a VDF). 
		This can be accomplished with kinetic-based finite-volume methods. With QBMM, the VDF is represented by a finite set of weighted delta functions, similar to 
		the lattice-Boltzmann method, but with velocities that vary in space and time. Using applications from disperse multiphase flows, I will discuss how QBMM are 
		applied to solve mesoscale models using the OpenQBMM.org software.</p>
